## 1. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement an **end-to-end data architecture** for *FlexiMart* that supports:

- Structured data storage for operational reporting  
- NoSQL data handling for flexible analysis  
- A data warehouse for analytical and decision-support queries  

The project demonstrates the practical application of **ETL processes, relational modeling, NoSQL concepts, and dimensional modeling** as covered in the course.

## 2. Project Scope

The project is divided into the following major components:

1. **ETL Processing**
   - Extraction of raw data  
   - Data cleaning and standardization  
   - Transformation into analysis-ready formats  

2. **Relational Database Design**
   - Normalized schema creation  
   - Support for transactional and operational queries  

3. **NoSQL Implementation**
   - Storage and analysis using MongoDB  
   - Handling semi-structured data efficiently  

4. **Data Warehouse Design**
   - Dimensional modeling using a star schema  
   - Support for scalable analytical queries  

---

## 3. Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** – ETL implementation and data processing  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **MySQL** – Relational database implementation  
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL data storage and analysis  
- **SQL** – Querying and analytical reporting  

---

## 4. Setup Instructions

All setup steps and execution instructions have been followed **exactly as provided in the assignment document**, without modification, to ensure consistency with evaluation requirements.

---

## 5. Key Learnings

- Designing **ETL pipelines** to handle inconsistent and incomplete source data  
- Applying **database normalization principles** for relational schema design  
- Understanding when to use **SQL vs NoSQL** based on data structure and use case  
- Implementing **dimensional modeling (star schema)** for analytical workloads  
- Translating business requirements into technical data models  

---

## 6. Challenges Faced and Resolution

### Challenge 1: Inconsistent Source Data Formats
- **Issue:** Variations in data types and missing values across datasets  
- **Resolution:** Implemented data validation, cleaning, and standardization during the ETL process  

### Challenge 2: Scalable Analytical Design
- **Issue:** Supporting efficient analytical queries on large datasets  
- **Resolution:** Designed a **star schema** in the data warehouse to optimize query performance  

---

## 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **complete data architecture pipeline**, integrating ETL processing, relational databases, NoSQL systems, and data warehousing concepts. The solution aligns with course objectives and supports both operational and analytical use cases.
